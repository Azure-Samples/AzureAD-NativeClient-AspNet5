# Calling a ASP.NET Core Web API from a WPF application using Azure AD

There's a newer version of this sample taking advantage of the Microsoft identity platform (formerly Azure AD v2.0)
Check it out: https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-native-aspnetcore-v2/tree/master/1.%20Desktop%20app%20calls%20Web%20API 

If you really need to access this Azure AD v1.0, you can navigate to the [master](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-native-aspnetcore/tree/master) branch, but please know that it's no longer supported.
